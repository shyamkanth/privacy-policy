      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Password Vault. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy
        Policy explains how our app handles your information, including what
        data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Personal Data</h3>
      <p>
        We do not collect, store, or share any personal data such as your name,
        email address, or phone number.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Passwords and Sensitive Information</h3>
      <p>
        All passwords, usernames, notes, and related information you store in
        Password Vault are saved locally on your device. This data is encrypted
        and never uploaded to our servers.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Usage Data</h3>
      <p>
        We may collect anonymous usage information such as app performance,
        error logs, and crash reports to improve the quality and stability of
        the app.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To ensure secure storage of your passwords locally on your device.
        </li>
        <li>
          To provide features such as password strength checking and vault
          management.
        </li>
        <li>To analyze app performance and fix bugs or crashes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        Your data security is our priority. Password Vault uses strong
        encryption methods to protect your saved information. Since the data
        never leaves your device, you are in full control of your information.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not share, sell, or transmit your personal information or stored
        passwords to any third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Password Vault may use third-party libraries such as Firebase for crash
        reporting. These services collect only non-identifiable information to
        help improve app stability.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Since all your data is stored locally on your device, you may manage,
        delete, or back up your information at any time through the app's
        settings.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be
        posted within the app and on this page with an updated effective date.
      </p>
