      <p>Effective Date: September 9, 2025</p>
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Japnaam. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy
        explains how our app manages your data, including what information we
        collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Japnaam is designed to help you track your jaap (chant counts), access a
        wide list of aartis, and manage your spiritual practices. We do not
        collect or store any personal information such as your name, email, or
        phone number.
      </p>
      <p>
        All your jaap counts, preferences, and notes are stored locally on your
        device. This information is never uploaded to our servers.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Usage Data</h2>
      <p>
        We may collect anonymous usage information such as crash reports and app
        performance data. This is done only to improve the stability and
        experience of the app. No personal or sensitive information is collected
        in this process.
      </p>

      <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>The information stored on your device is used to:</p>
      <p>
        - Track and display your jaap counts. <br />
        - Provide you access to aartis and related spiritual content. <br />
        - Enhance your app experience with personalized features. <br />
        - Fix bugs and improve app performance through crash reports.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We prioritize your privacy and data security. All jaap counts and
        related data are stored locally, ensuring that you remain in full
        control of your information. Since the app does not require internet to
        function, your data stays private.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        Japnaam does not share, sell, or transmit your personal information or
        jaap counts to any third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The app may use third-party libraries, such as Firebase, for crash
        reporting. These services collect only non-identifiable information
        necessary for improving the app's stability.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be
        reflected in the app and on this page with a revised effective date.
      </p>
